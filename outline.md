## Comparison of Frontend JavaScript Frameworks

React vs Angular vs Vue

### Welcome

* Thanks so much for being here and thanks for letting me come talk to you all about frontend frameworks
* This is a topic that's near and dear to my heart
* I started with learning HTML and then JavaScript, so I always like to find excuses to play around with React, Angular, and Vue

## Introduction

### Tell me about yourself

* Who is already using one of these frameworks?
* Who is completely happy with their choice?
* Who is looking to make a change?
* Who has been using React for over a year? Angular? Vue?
  * I need your help!
  * If I misspeak or do anything while coding that doesn't make any sense or you would do differently please call me out on it!

### Why are you here?

* Are you looking to learn your first framework?
* Are you looking to improve your marketability?
* Are you trying to solve a problem in your current situation?

### Goals

* The goal of this talk isn't to tell you everything that you need to know about these frameworks in order to be successful
  * It wouldn't be possible to do that for just one of these frameworks let along three
* The goal is to give you enough familiarity with each of the frameworks so that you can decide which you may want to take a closer look at
  * Or if you're already using a framework, whether or not it'd make sense for you to take a closer look at a different framework
* My personal goal is not make too much of a fool of myself as I flail from one framework to another

### Out of Scope

There's so much to talk about... something's got to go!

* Routing
* State Management
* Universal Rendering
* Mobile Development

### Framework vs Library

* Angular and Vue are frameworks and React is a library
* For simplicity sakes, when I refer to React as a framework I'm referring to its larger ecosystem

## Shared Concepts

### Concepts

What are the conceptual things that you need to know in order to be successful with any of these frameworks?

* SPAs
* Components
* Templating and Binding
* Virtual DOM
* Data Flow
* State Management
* Backend APIs
* Routing
* Language Abstractions
* Testing
* Front End Builds

### SPAs

* Will you be building a single-page application?
  * Or just adding some additional interactivity to server-rendered pages?

### Components

* Effectively leveraging components
* Knowing how to break an application into components

### Templating and Binding

* Where and how are templates defined?
* Binding syntax
* Rendering values
* Rendering lists
* Handling events

### Virtual DOM

* React and Vue both utilize a Virtual DOM
* In-memory representation of the physical DOM
* When the state of your app changes, comparisons are done to the virtual DOM in order to determine how the physical DOM should be updated

### Data Flow

* How does data flow between components?
* To child components
* To parent components

### State Management

* Where does state live your application?
* How is that state managed?
* Redux is a popular way of managing state
  * Supported in all three frameworks
  * Not the only way

### Backend APIs

* AJAX
* HTTP semantics
* Authentication (OpenID Connect, OAuth, JWTs)

### Routing

* How are routes defined?
* How do you redirect the user to another route?
* Are sub or nested routes supported?

### Language Abstractions

* HTML (JSX)
* CSS (Sass)
* JavaScript (TypeScript)

### Testing

* Unit testing
* E2E testing

### Front End Builds

* webpack is the defacto tool these days (sorry Grunt and Gulp)
* Linting
* Tree Shaking
* Bundling
* CLIs

## (Simple) App Demos

Focus on the following...

* Getting started
  * Project creation
  * Project layout
  * Dev workflow
* Basic components
  * Templating
  * Properties
  * Events

## Highlights

### Angular

* Pros - Capable CLI, all inclusive, opinionated, leverages native HTML and CSS
* Cons - Relatively verbose, can feel heavy handed or overly complex at times, difficult to getted started without the assistance of the CLI

### React

* Pros - Relatively simple, elegant in its design, focus on functional programming, broad community support
* Cons - Can feel a bit constraining or foreign at times, many ways to accomplish the same thing (i.e. less opinionated), you can't leverage native HTML (and sometimes even CSS)

### Vue

* Pros - Downgraded mode is brilliant, less opinionated (especially when compared with Angular), leverages native HTML and CSS
* Cons - Less community support (at this time), no "one way" to setup projects

## Other Thoughts

### Workflow

* Think about your development, testing, and production workflows
* Which framework will work best for your situation?
* Will one of the CLIs work for your use case?
* Or will you need to handle your frontend builds manually as part of your CI/CD process?

### CLIs

* Compare the three CLIs
* Strengths? Weaknesses?
* Angular CLI
  * Initial project setup
  * Components and services
  * Dev server
  * Build for production
* Create React App
  * Initial project setup
  * Dev server
  * Build for production
* Vue CLI
  * Initial project setup
  * Dev server
  * Build for production

### Forms

* Most devs tend to build lots of forms
* Angular offers the most built-in for forms and form validation
* Each framework also has libraries for building forms

### Performance

Is one framework the clear leader in performance?

### Universal or Server-side Rendering

### Mobile Dev

* React Native
* NativeScript

### Experience

* Learning one of these makes learning the next easier
* What things carry over from framework to framework?

### Learning

* Available resources
  * Treehouse
  * Egghead
  * Pluralsight

* Official docs
  * Quality of the docs counts
  * Vue is known for its good docs
  * But honestly I feel like all three are good

### Tooling Support

* Editors
  * VS Code
  * Atom
  * Visual Studio
* Debuggers (In-Browser)
* Control Vendors
* Online Tools
  * https://codesandbox.io/ <-- this is pretty cool
  * https://stackblitz.com/

### TypeScript Support

* First class support in Angular
  * The official docs use TS
* React and Vue both offer TS support but it might be more difficult to get started and support ongoing

### Popularity

Who's using these frameworks?

* Angular
  * Google
  * https://www.madewithangular.com/
* React
  * Facebook
  * Instagram
  * Twitter
  * Airbnb
  * Netflix
* Vue
  * Expedia
  * Nintendo
  * IBM
  * GitLlab
  * Sainsburyâ€™s

### Support

They're all open source projects... so GitHub issues :)

### Community

* Local meetups
* Conferences
* Online communities

## Wrap Up

### How do you decide on which to use?

* What does your dev team look like?
* What kind of app are you building?
* What features are most important to you?

### My Experience

* Using the downgraded Vue experience... is just fun
* I feel like React encouraged me to break things down into smaller and smaller components
* Angular feels the most C# like... thanks to TypeScript

### Your Experience

What has your experience been like?

### Advice

* Are you new to frontend frameworks?
  * Probably start with Vue
  * Get comfortable with the core concepts
  * Then go from there
* Are you experienced?
  * Review your requirements and team experience
  * Determine which would be the best fit from there

### Conclusion

* You can be successful with any of these frameworks
* Things will continue to change and evolve
* Picking the "right" framework is important, but it's more important to focus on the core concepts and skills that front end devs need to have in order to be successful
  * That will also equip you for whatever comes next... because you better believe that something new is right around the corner
* Don't worry too much about it... just make a choice and do your best :)
